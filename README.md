# git-project-Collin
-I implemented stage() and it works (I tested it many times and it works)
-I implemented commit() and it works (I tested with two commits)
-I implemented checkout and it works (I tested it with both commits)
-bugs fixed:
    -trees had the hashes of files inside
    -trees were made inside blobs so there were multiple files that displayed the same hashes even though they were different
    -debugged my commit method
